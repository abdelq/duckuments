# Bumper Assembly {#bumper-assembly status=draft}


<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: Duckiebot `DB17-lc` parts.

Requires: Having the Duckiebot with configuration `DB17-wjd` assembled. The assembly process is explained in [](#assembling-duckiebot-c1).

Requires: Time: about 15 minutes.

Results: A Duckiebot with Bumpers (configuration DB17-l2)

</div>

## Locate all required parts

The following should be included in your parts envelope (See image below for these components):

* 1x front bumper (Camera side)
* 1x rear bumper (the side of Caster/Omnidirectional wheel)
* 2x rear bumper brace (the side of Caster/Omnidirectional wheel)
* 8x M2.5x10 nylone or metall screws 
* 8x M2.5 nuts 


The following is not included in your parts envelope but will be needed for assembly:

* Small screwdriver

### Reminder: Use care when assembling! {#care}

When assembling, be sure to be gentle! Tighten screws just enough so that the parts will remain stationary. When inserting LEDs, gently work them into their holders. While the acrylic is relatively tough, it can be fractured with modest force. We don’t have many replacements (at this moment) so we may not be able to replace a broken part.

## Remove protective paper

Peel protective layer off of all parts on all sides.

## Assembly Rear Spacers 

### Disassembly the spacers between the both chassis

The backside of duckiebot before assemblying the bumpers looks as [](#fig:before_bumpers):
<div figure-id="fig:before_bumpers" figure-caption= "The configuration before assemblying the bumpers">
    <img src="before_bumpers.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Now remove the spacers and the (short)metall screws from the standoffs (configuration 'DB17-wjd') and replace it with 4 M3x10 nylon screws for connecting the chassis and the bumper spacers. 

<div figure-id="fig:screw_for_upgrade" figure-caption= "The spacers configuration for the bumpers, Left: old configuration, Right: new configuration">
    <img src="screwForUpgrade.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

<!--Disassemble the rear spacers. KEEP ALL HARDWARE (you will be using the 2 short screws that were connected to the bottom of the spacer later). Reassemble in the configuration shown in the images below (note that the rear bumper braces now act as spacers to preserve the height offset). Reinstall the longer M2.5 screws that were originally connected at the top, and replace the bottom screws with 2 of your M3x10 screws included in the envelope. You may need the pliers to grasp the hex spacers when tightening. Note [Reminder: Use care when assembling!](#care) -->

M3x10 screws attaching bottom rear brace:

</div>

Back View, fully assembled:

    <img src="back_view_fully_assembled.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Note: For the ETH students, the M3*10 nylon screws for attaching the rear spacers with chassis were already distributed during the duckiebot ceremony and not included in second distribution. Please reuse them!

### Mount Rear Bumper

Carefully guide rear bumper on to rear bumper brace tabs. Ensure that the hole for charging aligns with the charging port on your battery.

<div figure-id="fig:rear_bumpers" figure-caption="Front view of rear bumper">
    <img src="rear_bumpers.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Locate 4 M2.5 nylon/metall nuts and 4 M2.5*10 nylon screws. Place a nut in the wide part of the t-slot and thread a screw into the nut as shown in the following pictures. Note [Use care when assembling!](#care) If you are having trouble with the nuts falling out, take a small piece of transparent tape and place it over both sides of the t-slot with the nut inside. It won’t look as nice but it will be much easier to assemble.

Better: Test the screws and the nuts once by screwing them together before you use it for the bumpers. It make the fllowing assembly process much easier. 

Note: For ETH 2017, the screws and nuts using for this step are M2.5*10 nylon screws (white) and M2.5 nylon or metall nuts from the envelope. 

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_screw1" figure-caption = "Hold the nuts with the fingers">
    <img src="bumper_screw1.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>
<div figure-id="fig:bumper_screw2" figure-caption = "Screw the screws into nuts while holding the nuts with the fingers">
    <img src="bumper_screw2.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>


The completed rear bumper should look like this:

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_12" figure-caption = "Completed rear bumpers">
    <img src="image_12-1.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Congrats! your rear bumper assembly is complete!

## Mount Front Bumper

The front side of duckiebot in 'DB17-wjd' should look like in [](#fig:frontside_before_bumper)

Take 2x M2.5*10 nylon screws and 2x M2.5 nylon nuts and install them as shown in the following pictures. The first picture shows the correct holes to mount these screws (The correct position is the widest pair of 3mm holes beside the camera). The nuts should tightened on by a few threads (these are the two nuts that are not yet tightened at the top of the second picture):

<div figure-id="fig:frontside_before_bumper" figure-caption="Front side of configuration DB17-wjd, without bumpers">
    <img src="frontside_before_bumper.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Better: Before tighten the front bumper, you should organise the wires of LEDs going through the right holes of chassis. Take a look in [](#fig:LED_connections) The center LED should be bent at a right angle in the direction that the wire is fed through the body.

Take the front bumper and carefully press the LEDs into the flexure holders. Take care that the wires are routed behind the front bumper. Also note that the front center LED wire should not be crushed between the bumper and the right spacer (you will likely fracture the bumper if you try to force it). The center LED should be bent at a right angle in the direction that the wire is fed through the body (see [](#fig:front_bumper_LED)).

<div figure-id="fig:front_bumper_LED" figure-caption="Insert the LEDs before tighten the front bumper.">
    <img src="front_bumper_LED.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Position the bumper so that the nuts align with the t-slots. You may need to loosen or tigthen the screws to align the nuts. You may also need to angle the front bumper when inserting to get it
past the camera screws.

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_17" figure-caption = "Completed front bumpers">
    <img src="front_bumper_LED2.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Gently tighten the nuts. The front bumper should now stay in position.

Congrats! your bumper assembly is complete!
