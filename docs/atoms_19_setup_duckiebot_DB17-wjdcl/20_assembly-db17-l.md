## Assembly the Servo/PWM hat (`DB17-l1`)
Recommend: If you have Bumpers or caster to assembly, it is recommend to have Bumpers and caster assembled before the PWM hat. The assembly process is explained in [](#bumper-assembly) and [] (#caster_wheel_instruction).

### Locate the components for Servo/PWM hat
* Soldered PWM hat (1x)
* Nylon Standoffs (M3.5 12mm F-F) (4x)
* Power cable: short angled male USB-A to 5.5/2.1mm DC power jack cable
* Male-Male Jumper Wires (1x)
* Screwdriver

### Remove the hand-made USB power cable from DC Motor HAT

From now on, the DC Motor Hat will be powered by the PWM HAT via male -male jumper wire. Before that, the previous hand-made USB power cable needed to be removed. Insert the male-male jumper wire into `+` power terminal on the DC motor HAT (DC-end).

### Stack the PWM HAT above the DC motor HAT

Put a soldered Servo/PWM HAT board (in your Duckiebox) with 4 standoffs on the top of Stepper Motor HAT.

Insert the other end of male-male jumper wire into "**+5**"V power terminal on the PWM HAT (PWM-end). It leads the power to DC motor HAT.

### Power Supply for PWM HAT

To power the PWM/Servo HAT from the battery, plugin a short (30cm) angled male USB-A to 5.5/2.1mm DC power jack cable into PWM HAT. The other end of the power cable will plugin to the battery when it is in use.

## Assembling the Bumper Set (`DB17-l2`)

For instructions on how to assemble your bumpers set, refer to: [](#bumper-assembly).

## Assembling the LED HAT and LEDs (`DB17-l3`)

For instructions on how to assemble the LED HAT and related LEDs, refer to: [](#leds-setup).

TODO: finish above, estimate assembly time, add bumper assembly instructions, add LED positioning and wiring instructions, add castor wheel assembly instructions
