# Duckiebot - `DB17-lc` configurations {#part:building-duckiebot-c1}

This section contains the acquisition, assembly and setup instructions for the `DB17-lc` configurations. These instructions are separate from the rest as they approximately match the `b` releases of the Fall 2017 Duckietown Engineering Co. branches.
