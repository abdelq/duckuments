abstract="Summary. In spite of the success of traditional sampled-data theory in computer control it has some disadvantages particularly for distributed, asynchronous, and multi-rate system. Event based sampling is an alternative which is explored in this paper. A simple example illustrates the differences between periodic and event based sampling. The architecture of a general structure for event based control is presented. The key elements are an event detector, an observer, and a control signal generator, which can be regarded as a generalized data-hold. Relations to nonlinear systems are discussed. Design of an event based controller is illustrated for a simple model of a micro-mechanical accelerometer.",
