# Assembling the Duckiebot (`DB17-wjd` TTIC)  {#assembling-duckiebot-db17-ttic status=beta}

Point of contact: Andrea F. Daniele

Once you have received the parts and soldered the necessary components, it is time to assemble them in a Duckiebot. Here, we provide the assembly instructions for the configuration `DB17-wjd` (TTIC only).

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: Duckiebot `DB17-wjd` parts. The acquisition process is explained in [](#acquiring-parts-c0).

Requires: Having soldered the `DB17-wjd` parts. The soldering process is explained in [](#soldering-boards-c0).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motors-sketch2" figure-caption="The sketch of how to mount the motors.">
  <img src="howto_mount_motors_sketch2.jpg" style='width: 30em'/>
</div>

Note: Orient the motors so that their wires are inwards (i.e., towards the center of the plate).


#### Step 3

## Omni-directional wheel {#howto-mount-omni-wheel}

The Duckiebot is driven by controlling the wheels attached to the DC motors.
Still, it requires a _passive_ support on the back. In this configuration an omni-directional wheel is
attached to the bottom plate of the chassis to provide such support.

### Step-by-step guide

#### Step 1 (Optional)

If you do not have the 300mm Camera cable you can jump to *Step 3*.

If you do have the long camera cable, the first thing to do is removing the shorter cable that comes
attached to the camera module. Make sure to slide up the black connectors of the camera port on the camera
module in order to unblock the cable.

#### Step 2

Connect the camera cable to the camera module as shown in [](#fig:howto-mount-camera-cable).

- USB power cable (prepared in [](#power-cable-prep-c0)) (1x)
- DC Stepper Motor HAT (1x)
- M2.5x10 Nylon screws (or M2.5x12 nylon standoffs) (4x)

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motorhat-video">
    <dtvideo src="vimeo:236334482"/>
</div>

### Step-by-step guide

#### Step 1

Connect the wires of the USB power cable to the terminal block on the DC Stepper Motor HAT labeled as
"5-12V Motor Power" as shown in [](#fig:howto-mount-motorhat-cable).
The black wire goes to the negative terminal block (labeled with a minus: `-`) and the red wire goes to the
positive terminal block (labeled with a plus: `+`).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motorhat-cable" figure-caption="How to connect the USB power cable to
the DC Stepper Motor HAT.">
     <img src="howto_mount_motorhat_cable.jpg" style='width: 30em'/>
</div>

#### Step 2

Pass the free end of the camera cable through the opening in the DC Stepper Motor HAT as shown in [](#fig:howto-mount-motorhat-camera).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motorhat-camera" figure-caption="How to pass the camera cable through
the opening in the DC Stepper Motor HAT.">
     <img src="howto_mount_motorhat_camera.jpg" style='width: 30em'/>
</div>

#### Step 3

Connect the free end of the camera cable to the **CAMERA** port on the Raspberry Pi 3 as shown
in [](#fig:howto-mount-motorhat-connect-camera).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motorhat-connect-camera" figure-caption="How to connect the camera cable to
the CAMERA port on the Raspberry Pi 3.">
    <img src="howto_mount_motorhat_connect_camera.jpg" style='width: 30em'/>
</div>

To do so, you will need to gently pull up on the black connector (it will slide up) to allow the cable to
insert the port. Slide the connector back down to lock the cable in place, making sure it “clicks”.

Note: Make sure the camera cable is inserted in the right direction! The metal pins of the cable must
be in contact with the metal terminals in the camera port of the PI. Please be aware that different camera
cables have the text on different sides and with different orientation, **do not** use it as a landmark.

#### Step 4

Attach the DC Stepper Motor HAT to the GPIO header on the Raspberry Pi 3.
Make sure that the GPIO stacking header of the Motor HAT is carefully aligned with the underlying GPIO pins
before applying pressure.

Note: In case you are using a short camera cable, ensure that the camera cable does not stand between the
GPIO pins and the the GPIO header socket before applying pressure.

#### Step 5

Secure the DC Stepper Motor HAT using *4* M2.5x10 nylon screws.

Note: If you are planning on upgrading your Duckiebot to the configuration `DB17-l`, you can use *4* M2.5x12
nylon standoffs instead.

#### Step 6

Connect the motor wires to the terminal block on the DC Stepper Motor HAT as shown
in [](#fig:howto-mount-motorhat-motors).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motorhat-motors" figure-caption="How to connect the motor wires to the
terminal block on the DC Stepper Motor HAT.">
     <img src="howto_mount_motorhat_motors.jpg" style='width: 30em'/>
</div>

While looking at the Duckiebot from the back, identify the wires for left and right motor. Connect the
left motor wires to the terminals labeled as **M1** and the right motor wires to the terminals labeled
as **M2**. This will ensure that the pre-existing software that we will later install on the Duckiebot
will send the commands to the correct motors.

## Upgrade to `DB17-j` {#howto-upgrade-db17-j}

This upgrade equips the Duckiebot with manual remote control capabilities. It is particularly
useful for getting the Duckiebot out of tight spots or letting younger ones have a drive, in
addition to providing handy shortcuts to different functions in development phase.
The new configuration is called `DB17-j`.

[](#fig:howto-mount-db17j-parts) shows the components needed to complete this upgrade.

### Instructions

- Insert the USB receiver into one of the USB ports of the Raspberry Pi.
- Insert 2 AA batteries on the back side of the joystick.
- Turn on the joystick by pressing the `HOME` button. Make sure that the LED above the `SELECT` button is steady.

## Upgrade to `DB17-d` {#howto-upgrade-db17-d}

This upgrade equips the Duckiebot with an external hard drive that is convenient for storing
videos (logs) as it provides both extra capacity and faster data transfer rates than the microSD
card in the Raspberry Pi 3. Moreover, it is easy to unplug it from the Duckiebot at the end of the
day and bring it over to a computer for downloading and analyzing stored data.
The new configuration is called `DB17-d`.

## FAQ {#op-assembly-db17wjd-faq}

Q: If we have the bumpers, at what point should we add them?

A: You shouldn't have the bumpers at this point. The function of the bumpers is to keep the LEDs in place, i.e., they belong to `DB17-l` configuration. These instructions cover the `DB17-wjd` configurations. You will find the bumper assembly instructions in [](#assembling-duckiebot-c1).

Q: Yeah but I still have the bumpers and am reading this page. So?

A: The bumpers can be added after the Duckiebot assembly is complete.

Q: I found it hard to mount the camera (the holes weren't lining up).

A: Sometimes in life you have to push a little to make things happen. (But don't push too much or things will break!)

Q: The long camera cable is a bit annoying - I folded it and shoved it in between two hats.

A: The shorter cable is even more annoying. We suggest wrapping the long camera cable between the chassis and the Raspberry Pi. With some strategic planning, you can use the zipties that keep the battery in place to hold the camera cable in place as well ([see figure below-to add]())

TODO: add pretty cable handling pic

Q: I found that the screwdriver that comes with the chassis kit is too fat to screw in the wires on the hat.

A: It is possible you got one of the fatter screwdrivers. You will need to figure it out yourself (or ask a TA for help).

Q: I need something to cut the end of the zip tie with.

A: Scissors typically work out for these kind of jobs (and no, they're not provided in a Fall 2017 Duckiebox).
